          <h2>Chronixx</h2>
          <p>Chronixx was the 'stage' name his friends bestowed on him, replacing the name 'Little Chronicle' he was given as the 'junior' to his father, the artist Chronicle. A little star amongst his peers, he had shown a love for music and song writing from an early age. He was born October 10, 1992 and was named Jamar Rolando McNaughton. His father, a musician, recognised his talents and nurtured him in an environment in which he could grow into whatever area of music he chose. Always accompanying him to the studio, Jamar grew up around the likes of Burro Banton, Norris Man and the legendary Gregory Isaacs.</p>

          <h2>Jah9</h2>
          <p>Jah9 developed her sound in the underground poetry/live music scene, but now intends to take her word sounds to the world. Her signature sound has led to collaborations with platinum producer Donovan Bennett of Don Corleon Records, dancehall pioneer Rory Gilligan of Stone Love International, Sheldon Bernard and living legend Beres Hammond of Harmony House Music.</p>

          <h2>Kabaka Pyramid</h2>
          <p>Keron Salmon, known by his fans as Kabaka Pyramid, is an ever-evolving artist that has numerous ways of expressing his creativity. The ability to watch and learn from others around him has made him into somewhat of a Jack-of-all-trades. You can find him at Bebble Rock Studios, in his hometown Kingston, Jamaica, writing lyrics, producing tracks, engineering/recording himself or other artists, mixing songs, editing video/photos, or even learning to play the guitar! His passion for music began at early age when he would change the lyrics to popular songs and record his own version on his mother's tape recorder. What began as a humorous venture was actually a stepping stone for the artist we know today. Reggae music has always been a strong influence on the Kingstonian lyricist, but during high school it was Hip Hop music that captivated him, and you could find him walking to the canteen reciting his favorite Canibus or Inspectah Deck lines. The influence of both genres can be easily detected as he, and other Bebble Rock artists such as Koro-Fyah, seek to find the perfect fusion of the two cultural expressions. </p>

         <h2>Protoje</h2>
         <p>Born in the 80’s but wishing he was birthed in the 60’s, Protoje (Oje Ollivierre) is the fresh face with the freshest lyrical delivery, still having a feel of vintage reggae music but being a suitable update for the present time.   Indeed, Marley’s mantra was to “free the people with music.” Protoje’s mantra is to free the people with art. Music – his appointed contribution to the artistic revolution - is only one of the many distinct art forms. He takes up the mantle of spokesperson for the Movement and represents the evident unity among a large group of talented musical, literary and visual artists who have silently and patiently developed under the radar and are about to march together into a new era of prosperity for all.   Despite being the cousin of regular chart-topping producer, Donovan ‘Don Corleon’ Bennett, Protoje continues to resist the urge to lay his vocals on every other riddim in the dancehall mainstream.</p>
